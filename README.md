# hw4codequiz

## Purpose
To develop a code quiz or assessment.

## Challenges
Each week the same challenges present themselves. Where to begin? How to better manage my time and when to ask for help. The complexity of these assignments continue to grow, proving to be harder to follow along let alone keep up. This assignment had many layers to it. Over the past week I grasped some parts of the homework from learning activities but not all. I struggled with and continue to struggle with how it all works together. Getting lost at what makes this assignment tick type of thought process.

## Motivation
Focusing on the end result. Getting what I need out of the assignments and continuing to streghten my skill level so that I am able to secure a job post class completion.
