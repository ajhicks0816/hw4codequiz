# hw4codequiz

## Purpose
To develop a code quiz or assessment.

## Challenges
Each week the same challenges present themselves. Where to begin? How to better manage my time and when to ask for help. The complexity of these assignments continue to grow, proving to be harder to follow along let alone keep up. This assignment had many layers to it. I grasped some from learning activities throughout the week but not all.
